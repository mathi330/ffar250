              This drawing represents the flow of my hands when I type on my
              keyboard to create a program. It is a mix of the physical actions
              and keys that I use more, as well as an illustration of the flow
              of my thoughts as I work. This drawing reminds me of smoke or
              fire, and like fire, my thoughts and tool stay fundamentally the
              same, but I will never press the same exact sequence of keys and
              my thoughts will vary and evolve through the time I spend working
              and thinking of a piece. To me, my keyboard is an ever-changing
              mechanism wile still staying the same object.
