        <h1>Emotional Encyclopedia</h1>
        <p>
          Emotions, good or bad, are an integral part of life with an essential
          role in our everyday life. To artists, they can be inspirations or
          obstacles to creation. Therefore, having a good understanding of
          feelings can help navigate thoughts and life in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Emotions and feelings should be expressed in some way and not be
          kept repressed inside our heads. When a strong emotion overwhelms us,
          we should let it out in someway, let it be words, drawings, coloring,
          dance, music, or anything else. It can be as small as a doodle to
          something bigger as long as it helps put the emotions out into the
          outside world.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Once expressed, emotions should not be left aside and forgotten
          since they will most likely come back at some point in our life. The
          work done in the first tenet should be kept in a sort of emotional
          encyclopedia to remind ourselves that those emotions are here, that we
          live with them and that they are what makes us human and our life
          interesting.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          As a very emotional person, I feel like creating something using an
          emotion as a base, and forcing myself to do it helped me deal with
          them in my everyday life and developed my creativity. I think it was
          especially the case when I was angry or frustrated. Creating something
          made me calm down and thinking of it when I felt frustrated again made
          me feel more at ease because I had given it a physical/visual form. It
          no longer feels like some abstract power that makes me want to yellâ€¦
          For good emotions like happiness or excitement, it also made me happy
          when I created them and also when I think back on these images that
          are now associated to the emotion for me.
