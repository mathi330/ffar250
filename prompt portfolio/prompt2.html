              This short film is a dystopia where the world is ruled by
              machines. The humans from that world are required to be “model
              citizens” and continuously exposed, from birth to death, to what a
              “model citizen” is. People are being monitored, but because the
              monitoring is done in a way that seems friendly, they don’t
              necessarily see what is wrong with their lifestyle that is no
              different from livestock.
            </p>
            <p>
              This short film is a critique of advertisement, propaganda and how
              we don’t even notice this type of brainwashing, and what is
              socially acceptable/required for someone to do or be like. It
              conveys its critique by pushing these problems that can be hard to
              spot for someone inside the system to the extreme and forces the
              viewer to reflect on them as outsiders, making them much more
              obvious.
