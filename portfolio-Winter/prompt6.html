          I am an emerging media artist often referred to as, what some might
          call, a “university student.” I was introduced to programming by my
          father, an IT hoping to show his daughters the beauty of code. He
          taught me HTML and supported me when I got into an artistic program on
          interactive media. I explore styles and techniques that I discover at
          school like the De Stijl movement which geometric shapes I love, or
          creative ideas from the web and artists I discover there. I use
          programming as my primary tool to make interactive visuals.
        </p>
        <p class="content long-text">
          I find fascinating to see lines of code come to life as an interactive
          artwork. I like to compare myself to a writer. Through words, they
          create worlds, characters, and stories, while I use JavaScript to
          create a visual experience. Two elements that inform my practice are
          colors and movements because of how expressive I find them, but I am
          always curious to experiment with other mediums like sound.
        </p>
        <p class="content long-text">
          Once I have an idea, I put it on paper with a sketch and annotations.
          After that, I get on my computer and start coding the basic elements.
          For any idea, I must figure out how to make it, how each part works
          and interacts with the rest of the piece without getting errors or
          crashing the program. Then, I can have fun with the code and improve
          the design of the piece. I like to let spontaneity have a say in the
          development of a project, let a moment’s thought bring the artwork in
          some unexpected direction. My works are small archives of the journey
          I took and of the things I learned along the way.

          Computer Emotions (Practitioner Statement from September)
        </h3>
        <p class="content long-text">
          I am an emerging media artist often referred to as, what some might
          call, a “university student.” I was introduced to programming through
          my father, an IT hoping to show his daughters the beauty of code. He
          taught me HTML and supported me when I got into an artistic program on
          interactive media. I now explore styles and techniques that I discover
          at school like the De Stijl movement which geometric shapes I love, or
          creative ideas from the web, especially from Pinterest. I use
          programming as my primary tool to make interactive visuals. A reason I
          love computing is because I find fascinating to see lines of code come
          to life as an interactive artwork. I like to compare myself to a
          writer. Through words, they create worlds, characters, and stories,
          while I use JavaScript to create a visual experience. An idea can come
          at any moment and be triggered by anything: a passing thought, a
          discussion, my surroundings... Once I have an idea, I put it on paper
          with a sketch and annotations. After that, I get on my computer and
          start coding the basic elements. Once the technical aspect is
          finished, I can have fun with the code and finalize the visual of the
          piece. I will make changes as I go depending on the emotions I feel.
          Frustration might make me create something sharp and clean, excitement
          might make me add shapes… For me, my artworks are a journey and
          storage for my emotions and thoughts.
